**About Fidisoa Rasambainarivo**

I am a wildlife veterinarian interested in the ecological approaches to health and particularly the **"One Health" concept** and the field of **"Conservation Medicine"**. I study the multiple interactions between human, domestic animal and wildlife health in Madagascar.

I obtained my veterinary degree from the Department of Veterinary Medicine and Sciences (DESMV) of the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar and a Master's degree in epidemiology from the faculté de médecine vétérinaire of the Université de Montréal, Canada and a PhD in Biology (Ecology, Evolution and Systematics) at the University of Missouri Saint Louis, USA.

Using a combination of fieldwork, laboratory and data analysis as well as computational modeling, my research interests focus on the potential impacts of humans and domestic animals on wildlife health in various ecosystems in Madagascar.

To facilitate research in Madagascar, help build local scientific capabilities of Malagasy researchers and advance conservation science, I co-founded **Mahaliana Labs** in Madagascar and act as the scientific director. At Mahaliana, I lead and manage several research projects, mainly on the health and diseases of wild animals and their interactions with humans & domestic animals.

### Biomedical evaluation of lemurs and carnivores in Madagascar

```{r}
```

![](content/images/carnivores/collage_health.jpeg){width="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am leading a research program that aims to characterize the health of wild animals in Madagascar by establishing reference biomedical values.

For many wild animal species, basic blood analysis values are missing. Yet, they constitute an important piece of information to answer a simple question: **"What is a healthy lemur/fosa?"**.

These data can also be used to assess the effects of anthropogenic habitat change or provide means to compare health data of the same population longitudinally, between different wild populations, and with animals in captivity. The baseline data obtained through these biomedical survey projects are also used to guide animal reintroduction or translocations and have become a necessary tool for conservation action.

With this project, we aim to evaluate the impact of domestic animals on endemic wildlife and more specifically, **the potential for disease transmission between domestic animals, humans and endemic carnivores** in the Betampona Natural Reserve landscape, Madagascar. We describe and analyze the spatio-temporal interactions between species, identify risk factors of exposure and infection to selected pathogens in introduced domestic and peridomestic animal species in villages as well as endemic mammals within the protected area.

Using statistical and mathematical models, we will synthesize findings to **develop a framework for identifying areas where health management in domestic and wildlife is likely to be particularly valuable**. Despite the importance of these pathogens, mathematical models of transmission and spread remain rare. We will fill this gap by designing mathematical models to probe the scale of conservation impacts that could be achieved, grounding model structure on the data described.



### Improving rural livelihood and supporting wildlife conservation through poultry vaccination in villages near protected areas of Madagascar.

![Vaccinator administers eye-drop newcastle disease vaccine to chicken in villages near Betampona](content/images/chicken_vax/DSC_4527.JPG){width="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The goal of this project is to improve rural livelihood and reduce reliance on wild animals for meat consumption in villages neighboring protected areas.**

An important vulnerability associated with poultry farming in rural Madagascar is the array of pathogens to which the species is susceptible including Newcastle disease, causing outbreaks with mortality rates above 70% in unvaccinated flocks. In 2018, Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group initiated a project providing **free vaccinations against Newcastle disease for chickens** in 12 villages around the Betampona Natural Reserve (covering almost 700 households). The goal of this project has been to protect poultry from this devastating pathogen and improve availability of protein in family diets as well villagers' livelihoods, thereby reducing the pressure on wild animals in the forest. Throughout the project, Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group and Mahaliana Labs collected poultry demographic data from each participating household which allowed us to measure and show the positive impact of this project on chicken ownership and human livelihoods. In fact, participating households owned on average 12.4 more chicken and reported a 55% decrease in chicken losses due to ND than they did before the beginning of the project which surpassed the initial objective of this program.

### COVID19.mg: dashboard of reference

To meet the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, I pivoted my research to support public health efforts in Madagascar. I constructed and shared the dashboard that became the reference for public health organizations from the Ministry of Health to UNICEF in the country (www.covid19mg.org)

### Excess deaths during measles outbreak

![](content/images/publichealth/Excessdeaths.png)]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo in Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak.

### Prioritizing vaccination efforts at the regional level in Madagascar

![](content/images/publichealth/BivariateCasesold.jpeg){width="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial doses of COVID-19 vaccines are limited and countries, such as Madagascar, need to develop prioritization schemes to maximize the benefits of vaccination with very limited supplies. Policy makers in LMICs face the central question of how COVID-19 vaccine doses should be allocated among populations in the face of these constraints and considerations of burden. Here, we explore the question of how regional vaccine dose distribution might be designed to minimize the burden of COVID-19 in Madagascar.
